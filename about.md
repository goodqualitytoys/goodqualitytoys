I'm fed up with spending good money on cheap tat from China. Back in the good old days of the 80s my toys would be built to last. In fact some of them are still in good nick today, yet some of my son's toys last a matter of weeks before they break. Its not good enough and I'm on a mission to find the best toys without breaking the bank.

In fact I've noticed this trend doesn't just affect toys, it seems the quality of products is falling while they still cost the same (or more) to buy. Perhaps because of growing manufacturing costs or because of greedy businesses increasing their margins... who knows.

Whatever the cause, I'm fed of plasticky tat that doesn't last.
